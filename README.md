# gosweeper

Minesweeper like game written in go.

## Purpose

It's purpose is to have a small fun project, where I can experiment and learn about new things in go.
Main learnings/experimenting points would be:

* generics (**NOTE:** require go1.18+);
* gomobile.

## Dependencies

go.18+, because generics are used.

## Plan

* [] First implement a working CLI game.
* [] Refactor the code, once I know what pieces are necessary/used/etc and how the game pieces together.
* [] Try to make a mobile (android) app, using gomobile.
